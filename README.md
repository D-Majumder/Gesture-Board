Hand-Controlled Drawing Board
Overview
The Hand-Controlled Drawing Board is an interactive Python program that allows users to create drawings and write text using hand gestures. By tracking the movement of the user‚Äôs hand, the program provides an intuitive interface for artistic expression. Here are the key features:

Hand Tracking: The program uses computer vision techniques to detect and track the user‚Äôs hand movements in real-time.
Gesture-Based Actions:
One Finger: When the user raises one finger, they can freely write or draw on the virtual canvas.
Two Fingers: Raising two fingers enables color selection. The user can cycle through a palette of colors by moving their hand horizontally.
Five Fingers: Raising all five fingers triggers the board-clearing action, effectively wiping the entire canvas.
Canvas Interaction:
The canvas is a virtual drawing surface displayed on the screen.
Users can draw lines, shapes, and text by moving their hand.
The selected color is applied to the strokes.
Clearing the canvas allows users to start fresh.
Implementation Details
Language: Python
Libraries Used:
OpenCV: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
NumPy: Manipulating image data and handling arrays.
Pygame: Creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for the canvas.
Algorithm Flow:
Initialize hand tracking using OpenCV.
Continuously track hand landmarks (such as finger tips) in each frame.
Detect gestures based on the number of raised fingers.
Update the canvas with user-drawn strokes.
Handle color selection and canvas clearing.
Display the canvas and user instructions.
Usage
Install the required libraries (opencv-python, numpy, and pygame).
Run the Python script.
Raise one finger to draw, two fingers to select colors, and five fingers to clear the canvas.
Future Enhancements
Add more gesture-based actions (e.g., zoom, rotate).
Implement additional drawing tools (e.g., shapes, eraser).
Explore multi-user collaboration on a shared canvas.
